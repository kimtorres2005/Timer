# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal in developing this timer app was to enhance my skills in iOS app development using SwiftUI. I wanted to create a functional, interactive timer app with a user-friendly interface, where users can set their own countdown time, start, pause, resume, and reset the timer.

The app allows users to start a countdown, track the remaining time, and control the timer through intuitive buttons. You can also customize the countdown duration via the settings page.

My primary motivation for creating this app was to practice managing app states and timers in SwiftUI, while also incorporating design patterns like `@State`, `@Binding`, and `NavigationLink`. Additionally, this project helped me refine my UI design skills.

# Development Environment

To develop this app, I used **Xcode** as my Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This allowed me to write, debug, and test the app in one platform. I used **Swift** as the programming language, and the app was developed using **SwiftUI** for the user interface, ensuring a modern and responsive design.

Libraries/Frameworks used:
- **SwiftUI**: For building the user interface in a declarative style.
- **Foundation**: For time and date functionality.

# Useful Websites

These websites were essential for solving specific challenges and improving my understanding of the tools I used in this project:
* [SwiftUI Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/)
* [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com) - For learning advanced SwiftUI techniques.
* [GitHub](https://github.com) - For version control and pushing my project to a remote repository.

# Future Work

There are several improvements I plan to make to the app in the future:
* **Add Sound Notifications**: Implement sound or vibration when the timer finishes.
* **Custom Timer Intervals**: Allow users to choose from pre-set countdown intervals (e.g., 5, 10, 15 minutes).
* **Dark Mode**: Implement dark mode support for a better user experience in different lighting environments.
* **Timer History**: Track and display a history of completed timers for the user.
